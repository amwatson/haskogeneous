    For this project I want a consice way of writing interactive HTML pages.  

    I would like to write html in haskell using succinct "do" notation, 
as well as a template haskell -> javascript compiler for interacting with these web pages,
and putting java script inside the html in much the same way that other frameworks compile
to javascript. This way, we not only get better syntax, but we get server interaction for 
free, rather than having to include seperate tags like php or jsp.  
    
    I'm not very experienced with designing webframeworks, so I expect this won't scale very
well, but further down the line, I am sure somebody can fix that by messing with the server 
and template haskell.

    Weee I contributed!
